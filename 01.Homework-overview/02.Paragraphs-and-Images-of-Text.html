        <h1>Alcohol</h1>
        <p>In chemistry, an alcohol is an organic compound in which the hydroxyl functional group (-OH) is bound to
            a carbon atom. In particular, this carbon center should be saturated, having single bonds to three other
            atoms.
            An important class of alcohols are the simple acyclic alcohols, the general formula for which is
            CnH2n+1OH. Of these ethanol (C2H5OH) is the alcohol found in alcoholic beverages; in common speech the
            word alcohol refers to ethanol.</p>

        <h3>Toxicity</h3>
        <p>Alcoholic beverages have been consumed by humans since prehistoric times for a variety of hygienic, dietary,
            medicinal, religious, and recreational reasons.
            Primary alcohols (R-CH2-OH) can be oxidized either to aldehydes (R-CHO) (e.g. acetaldehyde) or to
            carboxylic acids (R-CO2H), while the oxidation of secondary alcohols (R1R2CH-OH) normally terminates at
            the ketone (R1R2C=O) stage. Tertiary alcohols (R1R2R3C-OH) are resistant to oxidation.</p>

        <h3>Nomenclature</h3>
        <p>In the IUPAC system, the name of the alkane chain loses the terminal "e" and adds "ol", e.g., "methanol"
            and "ethanol".When necessary, the position of the hydroxyl group is indicated by a number between the
            alkane name and the "ol": propan-1-ol for CH3CH2CH2OH, propan-2-ol for CH3CH(OH)CH3. Sometimes, the
            position number is written before the IUPAC name: 1-propanol and 2-propanol. If a higher priority group
            is present (such as an aldehyde, ketone, or carboxylic acid), then it is necessary to use the prefix
            "hydroxy", for example: 1-hydroxy-2-propanone (CH3COCH2OH).</p>
